# HEIC Pics

I created HEIC Pics to automatically convert HEIC images added to the Downloads folder. It can help when:

1. AirDropping a HEIC image to your Mac
2. Downloading a HEIC image from the web
3. Trying to quickly convert a HEIC image to a more usable format

No data of any kind is collected, shared, or stored outside of your Mac. All conversion is done locally using Apple libraries.
